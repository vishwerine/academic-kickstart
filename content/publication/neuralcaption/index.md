# Abstract.
abstract = "Automatic caption generation of images has gained significant interest.  It gives rise to a lot of interesting image-related applications.For example, it could help in image/video retrieval and management of vast amount of multimedia data available on the Internet.  Itcould also help in development of tools that can aid visually impaired individuals in accessing multimedia content.  In this paper, weparticularly focus on news images and propose a methodology for automatically generating captions for news paper articles consistingof a text paragraph and an image. We propose several deep neural network architectures built upon Recurrent Neural Networks. Resultson a BBC News dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms a traditional method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation usingboth automatic evaluation based on BLEU scores and human evaluation."
